# 🚀 Liberatus — 100x Engineers Code Track

Welcome to **Liberatus** — a collective of passionate, relentless builders on the **Code Track** of the [100x Engineers](https://100x.engineer) movement. We're here to **ship fast**, **learn together**, and **build products that matter**.

---

## 🔥 Who We Are

**Liberatus** (Latin for *"freed" or "liberated"*) represents our shared goal: to **free ourselves from inertia**, **excuses**, and **average outcomes**. We are coders, tinkerers, AI engineers, product thinkers, and system builders committed to leveling up through:

- Daily code pushes  
- Weekly project milestones  
- Peer learning and mentorship  
- Brutally honest feedback  
- Unreasonable ambition

---

## 🛠️ What We Do

We build, break, and rebuild—fast. Our projects range from:

- 🧠 AI Tools & Agents  
- 📊 Dashboards & Internal Tools  
- 📱 Web Apps / APIs  
- 🤖 Automation & Scripts  
- 🌐 Open Source Utilities  

Each of us commits to pushing **production-grade projects** with real users, rapid iterations, and clear KPIs.

## 📆 Cadence & Culture

- **Daily:** Share code updates or blockers in our group thread  
- **Weekly:** Demo what you shipped (no slide decks — show code!)  
- **Bi-weekly:** Review each other’s projects and share feedback  
- **Monthly:** Set public goals & stretch challenges  

> Our culture is simple: **Build or be built over.**

## 👊 How to Win Here

- Be **consistent** — small wins daily compound big  
- Be **accountable** — update, show up, deliver  
- Be **collaborative** — ask, share, help, pair  
- Be **brutally honest** — feedback fuels growth  
- Be **unreasonable** — dream big, ship bigger

## 🧑‍💻 Core Stack & Tools

We use what helps us move fastest:

- `Python`, `FastAPI`, `Node.js`, `TypeScript`  
- `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB`, `Redis`  
- `Streamlit`, `Next.js`, `TailwindCSS`  
- `Docker`, `Vercel`, `Railway`, `Render`  
- `OpenAI`, `LangChain`, `Pinecone`, `Playwright`

…but stack doesn’t matter — **shipping does.**

---

## 🚨 You’re in if...

- You push code, not just talk ideas  
- You’ve got a hunger to build things users love  
- You can take (and give) real feedback  
- You're playing the long game, but building like you're short on time
