"Transform the subject of the image into a small plastic collectible toy figure, styled like a McDonaldâ€™s Happy Meal toy. The figure should have a cute, cartoon-like appearance with simplified facial features, glossy plastic texture, and a slightly exaggerated pose or expression for charm. Include a McDonald's cheeseburger and a Happy Meal box in the background, scaled to match the toy. Use soft studio lighting and a clean, minimal background (white or beige) to mimic a product showcase. Emphasize vibrant colors, smooth surfaces, and toy-like proportions to create a fun and polished look."
